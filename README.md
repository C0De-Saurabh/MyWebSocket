# Experimental WebSocket Repository

Welcome to my **Experimental WebSocket Repository**! 🚀

## About
This repository is a playground where I am experimenting with **WebSockets** to deepen my understanding of real-time communication over the web. My goal is to explore different aspects of WebSocket technology, including:
- Establishing and maintaining WebSocket connections.
- Sending and receiving messages in real time.
- Handling connection errors and reconnections.
- Implementing WebSocket-based applications.

## Why WebSockets?
WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, making them ideal for real-time applications like:
- Chat applications 💬
- Live notifications 🔔
- Online multiplayer games 🎮
- Collaborative tools 📝

## Status
🛠 **This is an experimental project, and things may change frequently!**

## Contributions
Since this is primarily for my own learning, contributions are not expected. However, if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue
